      <description>Excel is indispensable for two reasons: Easy for business users Goto tool for many years so tough to move away Best User friendly CURD (Create, Udpate, Read and Delete) tool ever built(in my opinion)
However excel seriously lacks below: A C I Frequent crash and ability to start from where it was left(Durability)

      <description>I am a big believer in Cal Newport/Steve Martin&#39;s philosophy of one should get too good to be ignored. How can one get build their skill set? Cal Newport answer is building a deep work habit for x hours. This is a lead measure to achieve your future goal of to be a better data scientist.
Who is a best data scientist? One who creates a product that directly contributes to increasing revenue or cutting cost.</description>
