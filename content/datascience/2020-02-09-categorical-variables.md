**what is a categorical variable?**

Any variable that is not numeric is a categorical value. Machine learning models can understand only numberics. All other data formats should be converted to a number including time.

**what are  ordinal variables and label encoding?**
Ordinal variables have a clear ranking like customer rating scale of   poor,average and  excellent . Ordinal variables can be endoced using a technique called Lebel encoding.
label the variables in the linear order eg:or,average and  excellent converts to 1,2 and 3

**what are  nominal variables and one hot encoding?**
Nominal variables dont have any ranking like country names or colors in a dataset.Nomonal variables can be encoded using one hot encoding. Hot encoding can be done by creating n digits where n is number of cateories and adding 1 to a particaular cateogry.Say country India,Bangladesh and Pakistan can be encoded as 100,010 and 001 respectively.
