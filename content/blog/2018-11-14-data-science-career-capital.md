I am a big believer in Cal Newport/Steve Martin's philosophy of one should get too good to be ignored.
How can one get build their skill set? Cal Newport answer is building a deep work habit for x hours. This is a lead measure to achieve your future goal of to be a better data scientist.

Who is a best data scientist?
One who creates a product that directly contributes to increasing revenue or cutting cost. But not all gets a chance to work in such setup. So what to do?Answer is leadership. Not in terms of managing head count but in terms of the opinion being respected and being right most of the times. 

I am borrowing thinking from [Cassie](https://mlconf.com/interview-with-cassie-kozyrkov-chief-decision-scientist-at-google-by-reshama-shaikh-program-committee-member/).
Below bullets are kind of good manifest to begin with:

>* Useful is worth more than complicated
>* Data quality is worth more than method quality
>* Communication skills are worth more than yet another programming language

Get out and be useful!Starting tomorrow will post my learnings on Data Analysis with Python
