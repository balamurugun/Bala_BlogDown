Data science is the art of converting business problem to data problem to data solution to business solution as a quote goes.

Doing sophisticated Data science work sincerely and removing the expectations of result will not help.
Data science should aim for atleast one of the below:
1) Increase revenue
2) Reduce cost
3) Better forecast
4) Remove complexity
5) Help someone to do these effectively with analysis

Above all one should garner the respect of the stakeholders
