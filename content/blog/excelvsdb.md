Excel is indispensable for two reasons:
Easy for business users 
Goto tool for many years so tough to move away
Best User friendly CURD (Create, Udpate, Read and Delete) tool ever built(in my opinion)

However excel seriously lacks below:
A
C
I
Frequent crash and ability to start from where it was left(Durability)
