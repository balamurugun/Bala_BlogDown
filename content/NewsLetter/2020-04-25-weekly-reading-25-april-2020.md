If you are reading this newsletter at first short and you have less than 5 tabs in your browser you don't need them :)
Few gems from the conversation:

+Stop being so goal focused and instead become habit focused. You don't want to accomplish some big goal, all you want to do is do fun stuff that makes you a better person. As a result of that, you'll probably accomplish some cool goals.

+ Some helpful tools are reminders, taking notes, reviewing prior decisions, and advice from other people

+ Break the problems down into smaller tasks until the first task is too small to offer resistance.Almost everything in my to do list these days can be executed in under 10 minutes. 

+ 3sec rule: If you want to do something, don't give yourself time to come up with an excuse not to, because you will convince yourself.
