Best defence agaisnt scams and frauds is to get ,as the author calls, intellectual vaccination by getting repeated exposure to benign, non-functional specimens.

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given a choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door -- say, No. 1 -- and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door -- say, No. 3 -- which has a goat. He then says to you,"Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
